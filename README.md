### BLOG API

Separating concerns between backend (express API) and frontend (React), to build a blog where user can comment blog posts and edit their comments; only the admin has access to Admin Dashboard, where is possible to post, modify, delete blog posts, or publish/unpublish them. Access is managed via web tokens.
